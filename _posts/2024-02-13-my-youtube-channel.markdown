I have started a [YouTube Channel][youtube-channel] and plan to add C++ content along with other software engineering related topics. I figure it can't hurt while looking for a job to actually show potential employers that I know more than how to put keywords on a resume, but can actually talk about them. Even if they look at a video for 30 seconds or just see the titles, it puts me ahead of the competition, I'd think. With the job market being what it is, competing against millions of laided off developers, it can't hurt, right?
