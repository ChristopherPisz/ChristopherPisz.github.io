I've added a github page using Jekyll. C++ is my primary language and I don't know much about web development, but I figured it might be handy to create a static page/blog and see if this works, because I'd like to stop using CMS for the community garden I am involved with and I figure the org could host a static page using github for free easy enough.

Who knows, maybe I'll make a blog myself if I have things worth blogging about related to my github.

I've created a devenv for using Jekyll via docket container and checked in the docker file at 

Check out my [Jekyll Devenv Repo][jekyll-devenv] for if you'd like to see how I created the container. I am just attaching to it via VSCode, editing, and using the terminal from there to push my changes.
