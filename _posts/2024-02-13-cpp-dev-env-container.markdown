I created a docker container for C++ with the Conan Package manager. This makes it easier to colabortate, tutor, etc, and not deal with
issues related to environment. You can take a look at my [C++ Devenv Repo][cpp-devenv] if you'd like to see how I created the container.

I also had started a [YouTube playlist][youtube-cpp-pipeline] on streamlining your C++ Pipeline where this was one of the things mentioned. I'm currently working on the next videos for it.
